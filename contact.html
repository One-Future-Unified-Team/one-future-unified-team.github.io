<h1>Contacting Us</h1>
<p>Unlike Facebook, Google and etc, we are open for everyone to contact us for any and all purposes. You could contact One Future Unified Team for many purposes, like support, feedback, bugs report, suggestion, donation, sponsorship and etc. Please do not contact us for promotion and spam through, we wouldn't send any replies to non-related email in my mailbox.</p>
<p>One Future Unified Team is a busy indie team, we have very less members in our team, in fact only 3 members in the entirety of the team so it might take a while for the team to receive your message and send back a reply. We will try our best to reply each and all tickets as soon as possible too so please be patient. It would take us around 3 business days for us to reply too. We also only reply during our business hours via official platforms, which is listed below.</p>
