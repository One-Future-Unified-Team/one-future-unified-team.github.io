<h1>Contacting Us</h1>
<p>Unlike Facebook, Google and etc, we are open for everyone to contact us for any and all purposes.

<p>One Future Unified Team is a busy indie team, we have very less members in our team, in fact only 3 members in the entirety of the team so it might take a while for the team to receive your message and send back a reply.

We also only reply during our business hours via official platforms, which is listed below.</p>
